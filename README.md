# Underwater Vehicle Scripts for Vision Based Tasks
Underwater Vehicle scripts were used in TEKNOFEST 2019. All implementations were done with Python3, OpenCV and Debian based Linux OS.
<br/>
Circle and square shape detection were required to complete some of the tasks. The important part is both implementations are based on pixel wise processes. Thus, brightness of the frame effects the result significantly. 
<br/>
## Script Examples
As can be seen below, both detection scripts work properly in indoor environment. They can be adjusted in the code.
